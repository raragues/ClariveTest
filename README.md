# ClariveTest

There are two files (two java classes): Prueba and PruebaTest

Prueba.java runs the complete exercise. It takes the number field from "http://support.clarive.com/rule/json/test?user=raragues" and calculates the factorial of that number showing it through the console. 

PruebaTest.java runs 6 test cases explained within the testCasesFactorial() method. 

Each class can be executed individually by running javac command in a console 
(javac filename [options])
Example: javac Prueba.java
